# Medio - YouTube Converter
Medio is a software that provides users with a seamless and effective approach to downloading videos and extract audios in a variety of formats from YouTube. Its user-friendly interface empowers users to effortlessly enter the URL of a YouTube video, apply additional settings, such as modifying the quality or filename, before initiating the download. Medio supports an array of video formats, comprising MP4, MVK, AVI, FLV, WMV and MOV and audio formats, including MP3, OGG, WAV, M4A, AAC and WMA which offers users abundant options to choose from.

The software is designed with a user-centric interface that is accessible to all users, irrespective of their technical proficiency. Unlike many other YouTube Converters, which may take a protracted duration to download a single video, Medio is engineered to support high-speed downloads, thereby enabling users to download videos and audios within a matter of seconds. This guarantees that users can quickly and effortlessly access their desired content without incurring substantial wait times. 

Furthermore, it provides users with various licenses, such as the Premium License, granting access to supplementary features and functionalities. With the Premium License, users can download entire playlists from YouTube, access new formats, and tweak the download speed to their preferred level. The software is made readily available for download without charge, enabling them to evaluate the software without the need for a license and benefit from unrestricted downloads. This affords them a valuable opportunity to experience the software's user-friendliness and operational efficiency firsthand.

Developed with Visual Studio 2022, Medio is versatile software compatible with both `Windows` and `Linux` systems. For operation, it necessitates the `.NET Framework 6.0` or higher to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience across diverse platforms.
