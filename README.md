### Encore License Benefits

- **Full Access to Settings:** Unlocks all video and audio formats, as well as various buffer sizes.
- **Secure License Key Storage:** Links the license key to the account in Medioâ€™s database.
- **Increased Download Bandwidth:** Provides enhanced bandwidth limits for faster download speeds. Users can further increase their download speed by adjusting the buffer size in the settings. Increasing the buffer size, which ranges from 1024 to 9216, can help optimize download speed by allowing more data to be preloaded during the download process. This is especially useful for high-speed internet connections and large files.
- **Expanded History:** Extends the history to 10 pages for more detailed tracking of download activities.

### Premium License Benefits

Includes all benefits of the Encore License, plus:

- **Further Expanded History:** Extends the history to 25 pages for more detailed tracking of download activities.
- **Unlimited Download Bandwidth:** Removes restrictions on download bandwidth, allowing for maximum speed based on your internet connection and system performance.
- **Playlist Downloader Feature:** Enables downloading entire playlists from YouTube.

## Free Trial License Key

Purchasing a lifetime license key grants unrestricted use of Medio at any location and time. Once activated, the features associated with the selected license become permanent for the Medio software. This permanence is maintained unless the software is reinstalled in a different directory path or installed on a new device. In such cases, the license key must be redeemed again to load the latest information from the database. 

For those wishing to evaluate Medio's functionality and features before purchasing, a license key can be redeemed below. Upon redemption, the next **10** downloads will be unrestricted and include access to the Playlist Downloader feature. Each device can redeem the key only once. After another redeem, the key can still be entered but won't enable temporary premium features.

**Access Medio's Complete Feature Set with this Key:**

Free Trial License:     PT4O-5TYD-WKTV-0ZZ7

In the unlikely event of complications during the purchase process, direct all license-related queries or refund requests to the developer.

## Getting Started Guide

Optimize your settings before starting any downloads to match your preferences. Follow these steps for a streamlined process:

### Step 1: Configure Settings

- Navigate to the **Settings** page.
- Select the desired format and adjust preferences such as buffer size to match your requirements.

### Step 2: Download Content

1. **Open the Converter:**
   - Access the `Converter` tab from the sidebar on the left.

2. **Select Download Type:**
   - Choose `Download Video` for videos or `Download Audio` for audio tracks.

3. **Input URL:**
   - Paste the YouTube URL into the designated field at the top of the Converter tab.

4. **Adjust Additional Settings:**
   - **Save Location:** Click the three dots next to the `Choose a Folder Path` field to specify the save directory. All downloaded files will be stored in this location, so it is recommended to use a separate folder for playlists to keep files organized.
   - **File Naming:** Enter a custom name for your file in the `Title your Video` field. For single videos or audios, a custom name can be selected, while for playlists, the original title will be used.
   - **Quality Selection:** Choose your preferred resolution from the provided list. This selection will be applied during the downloading process and can help to reduce the file size.

5. **Initiate Download:**
   - Click the `Start Download` button to begin. The application will display the download status in the upper right corner, showing progress and completion indicators. The `Loading Tools` status indicates that it is starting all necessary processes for downloading and converting while reading the size of the video. The time required for this step depends on the size of the video from YouTube and the internet connection but usually takes only a few seconds.

> **Note:** Medio processes valid links only. An "invalid link" status will be shown for unrecognized URLs.

For further assistance or information, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BerndHagen/Medio-YouTube-Converter/issues) on the GitHub repository or consult the FAQ section in the 'Settings' tab.

## Updating Software

To maintain optimal performance and stability when downloading audio or video content from YouTube, it is crucial to use the latest version of Medio. Updates bring enhanced features and fix bugs that could compromise the software's performance. Using an outdated version may lead to incomplete downloads or failures during content conversion. The Build Number version can be found in the bottom left corner of the application, which can be used to check if there is a newer version of Medio available on this GitHub Repository.

To update your Medio software, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version from the repository and save it to your device.
2. Open the downloaded **ZIP** folder and start the Medio setup to initiate the installation process.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation, replacing any old files with the new updates.
4. Once the installation is complete, launch the application.

For optimal performance, make sure the installation path is set to `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Arctisoft-Studio\Medio - YouTube Converter` during setup. This prevents potential issues and ensures that features are not blocked due to a lack of administrative rights.

## Third-Party Libraries

Medio leverages several third-party libraries to enhance its functionality. One key library used in the application is **FFmpeg**, which plays a crucial role in media processing tasks.

- **FFmpeg:** FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia framework used for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. It is used by Medio for video and audio format conversion, as well as for encoding and decoding media files.

  - **Website:** [FFmpeg Official Website](https://ffmpeg.org)
  - **License:** FFmpeg is licensed under the LGPL or GPL, depending on the configuration and features enabled.

For more details about FFmpeg, including its capabilities and licensing, please refer to the [FFmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html).

If you have any questions or issues regarding the use of FFmpeg with Medio, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/BerndHagen/Medio-YouTube-Converter/issues) on GitHub.

## Retrieving Data from Database

By purchasing a license key and redeeming it again in the `Settings` tab under `Key Activation`, **Medio** allows the retrieval of personal data from the database. This process includes downloading:

- **Personal Settings**
- **Avatar**
- **Experience Points**
- **Level**
- **Total Megabytes Downloaded**
- **Amount of Audios and Videos Downloaded**
- **Latest Download**

**Important:** While this process restores most of your personal data, some information such as the **Download History** is stored locally on the device and cannot be recovered from the database. Consequently, any locally stored Download History will be lost if Medio is set up on a new device!
